# Hack-Cambridge-2019-my-contribution-only

This repository contains my contribution to my team's (four people) submission to Hack Cambridge 101, held in Janurary 2020. 
The goal of the project was to optimize waste collection in cities. Using smart bins with a hardware (created by one of my colleagues) sensing the percentage of their own fullness (using a distance sensor placed on top and facing downwards), we were able to provide real-time statistics of priority of collection and the specific recycling material of each bin, all displayed on a google map as a front-end. These were then used to suggest the best placement for new bins (if necessary) in overpopulated areas and to calculate the most optimal routes for waste collection vehicles (using a modified Djikstra algorithm).

My contributions came in real-time data processing, statistics and new waste collection points placement suggestions.
